# useSettings Hook Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Import Path Issue
- **Problem**: TypeScript was unable to resolve the import path `@/components/settings/SettingsTypes`
- **Solution**: Changed the import to use a relative path `../components/settings/SettingsTypes`
- **Result**: Import now resolves correctly

### 2. Type Safety Improvement
- **Problem**: The merged settings object wasn't properly typed
- **Solution**: Added explicit type annotation `const mergedSettings: SettingsType`
- **Result**: Better type safety and IntelliSense support

## Code Changes Made

### Before (with issues):
```typescript
import { SettingsType } from '@/components/settings/SettingsTypes';
```

### After (fixed):
```typescript
import { SettingsType } from '../components/settings/SettingsTypes';
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Robust Merging**: The merging logic ensures all nested properties from the default settings are preserved
2. **Dark Theme Enforcement**: The hook continues to enforce dark theme as intended
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for localStorage operations
4. **Type Safety**: Explicit typing for better development experience

## Testing

The hook has been tested and compiles successfully with TypeScript. The implementation maintains all existing functionality while fixing the import resolution issue.

## No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality remains intact:
- Settings are properly loaded from localStorage
- Default settings are used when localStorage is empty or corrupted
- Dark theme is enforced as intended
- Nested object merging works correctly
- Update and reset functions work as expected
