-- Database initialization script for SaadhanaBoard
-- This script will be run automatically when the PostgreSQL container starts

-- Create the database (if not exists)
CREATE DATABASE saadhanaboard;

-- Connect to the database
\c saadhanaboard;

-- Create tables and initial data would go here
-- For now, this is just a placeholder as the application has its own initialization scripts

-- Note: The application's own initialization script (utils/initDb.js) should be run after the container starts
