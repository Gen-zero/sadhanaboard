## Theme Improvements

This theme has been simplified and improved with:

1. **Elegant Design**: Cleaner particle effects with reduced visual noise
2. **Performance**: Optimized particle count and movement for better performance
3. **Harmonious Colors**: More consistent and pleasing color palette
4. **Subtle Animations**: Gentle pulsing effects instead of aggressive movements
5. **CSS Enhancements**: Additional styling for a more cohesive look

The Durga yantra now rotates more slowly (60 seconds per rotation) for a more meditative experience.
