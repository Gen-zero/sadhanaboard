    traditions: ["Hinduism", "Yoga", "Vedanta"],
    content: `The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. The Gita is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Krishna.

Facing the duty as a warrior to fight the Dharma Yudhha or righteous war between Pandavas and Kauravas, Arjuna is counselled by Krishna to fulfill his Kshatriya (warrior) duty as a warrior and establishing Dharma.

Chapter 1: Arjuna's Dilemma

Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjaya, after my sons and the sons of Pandu assembled in the field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle, what did they do?

Sanjaya said: Seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke these words:

"O teacher, behold this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arranged in battle formation by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.

Chapter 2: Sankhya Yoga (The Yoga of Knowledge)

Sanjaya said: Having thus been addressed by Arjuna, who was overwhelmed with compassion, his eyes filled with tears and lamenting, Madhusudana (Krishna) spoke the following words.

The Supreme Lord said: Whence has this timidity come upon you at this hour of crisis? It is not befitting an honorable person. It leads neither to heaven nor to fame.

Do not yield to unmanliness, O Partha (Arjuna). It does not become you. Cast off this petty weakness of heart and arise, O scorcher of enemies.

---PAGE---

Arjuna said: How shall I strike Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of worship, with arrows in battle, O slayer of enemies?

It would be better to live in this world by begging than to slay these noble elders. By killing them, even though they desire wealth, all our enjoyments will be stained with blood.

We do not know which is better for us, whether we conquer them or they conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra, whom having slain we would not wish to live, stand before us.`,

Chapter 1

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;
This appears as darkness.
Darkness within darkness.
The gate to all mystery.

Chapter 2

When people see some things as beautiful,
other things become ugly.
When people see some things as good,
other things become bad.

Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy support each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low depend on each other.
Before and after follow each other.

Therefore the Master
acts without doing anything
and teaches without saying anything.
Things arise and she lets them come;
things disappear and she lets them go.
She has but doesn't possess,
acts but doesn't expect.
When her work is done, she forgets it.
That is why it lasts forever.`,

Chapter 1: The Pairs (Yamakavagga)

1. Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

2. Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts, happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow.

3. "He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me." Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.

23. The wise ones, ever meditative and steadfastly persevering, alone experience Nibbana, the incomparable freedom from bondage.

Chapter 3: The Mind (Cittavagga)

33. The flickering, fickle mind, difficult to guard, difficult to control — the wise person straightens it as a fletcher straightens an arrow.

34. Like a fish that is drawn from its watery abode and thrown upon land, even so does this mind flutter. Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.

35. The mind is hard to control; swiftly and lightly, it falls wherever it pleases. To control it is good. A controlled mind brings happiness.`,

    author: "Various Sages",
    traditions: ["Hinduism", "Vedanta"],
    content: `The Upanishads are late portions of the Vedas, the ancient Sanskrit texts that contain the earliest emergence of some of the central religious concepts of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. They are commonly referred to as Vedānta, variously interpreted to mean either the "last chapters, parts of the Veda" or "the object, the highest purpose of the Veda".

The Upanishads are the foundation of Hindu philosophical thought and its diverse traditions. They have influenced other Indian religious traditions and have had influence far beyond India.

From the Katha Upanishad:

The knowing self is not born; it does not die. It has not come from anywhere; it has not become anyone. It is birthless, eternal, everlasting, and ancient. When the body is killed, it is not killed.

If the killer thinks he kills and if the killed thinks he is killed, neither of them understands. The self neither kills nor is killed.

The self, smaller than small, greater than great, is hidden in the heart of all living creatures. A man free from desires, with his mind and senses purified, sees the glory of the self and becomes free from sorrow.

From the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:

In the beginning, this universe was the self (Purusha) alone, in the shape of a person. Looking around, he saw nothing else than the self. He first said, "I am" (aham asmi). From that the name "I" arose. Therefore, even today, when a person is addressed, he first says "It is I" and then says whatever other name he may have.

From the Chandogya Upanishad:

"That which is the finest essence – this whole world has that as its soul. That is Reality. That is Atman (Self). That art thou, Svetaketu."

"Please, venerable Sir, explain this to me again," said the son.

"So be it, dear boy," the father replied. "Bring me a fruit from the banyan tree."

"Here it is, venerable Sir."

"Break it open."

"I have broken it open, venerable Sir."

"What do you see there?"

"Very small seeds, venerable Sir."

"Break one open."

"I have broken it open, venerable Sir."

"What do you see there?"

"Nothing at all, venerable Sir."

The father said: "Dear boy, that subtle essence which you do not perceive – from that very essence this great banyan tree arises. Believe me, dear boy, that which is the subtle essence, this whole world has that as its self. That is Reality. That is Atman (Self). That art thou, Svetaketu."`,
