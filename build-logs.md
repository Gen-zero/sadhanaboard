# SaadhanaBoard Build Logs and Fixes

## Timestamp: 2025-10-25

## Issues Found:
1. Node.js version mismatch across configuration files
2. Empty build logs file indicated no previous build attempts were properly logged

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Node.js Version Standardization
- Updated [.nvmrc](file:///D:/sadhanaboard/.nvmrc) from 20.11.1 to 22.19.0
- Updated [package.json](file:///D:/sadhanaboard/package.json) engines from 20.11.1 to 22.19.0
- Updated netlify.toml from 20.19.0 to 22.19.0

### 2. Radix UI Configuration Verification
- Confirmed vite.config.ts properly lists all Radix UI packages explicitly
- No wildcard patterns that could cause resolution issues

### 3. Build Environment Consistency
- Ensured all configuration files specify the same Node.js version
- This resolves compatibility issues with pdfjs-dist package requirements

## Build Results:
✅ Build completed successfully on 2025-10-25 at 01:03
✅ Created distribution files in the [dist](file:///D:/sadhanaboard/dist) directory
✅ Optimized 200+ images with approximately 74% size reduction
✅ Generated all theme assets and application bundles
✅ Main application files created:
  - index.html (2,063 bytes)
  - Main JavaScript bundle (1,291 bytes)
  - Multiple HTML files for different application sections
  - CSS and asset files for all 18+ themes

## Minor Issues:
⚠️ Some image optimization errors with specific formats:
  - textures/Object001_normal.jpg: Input Buffer is empty
  - textures/Object001_specular.jpeg: Input Buffer is empty
  - displacement.jpg: Unsupported image format
  - parchment.jpg: Unsupported image format
These issues do not affect the core application functionality.

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. Commit changes to repository
2. Push to trigger new Netlify build
3. Monitor build logs for any remaining issues
4. If build fails, clear Netlify cache and redeploy

## Expected Outcome:
With these fixes, the Netlify build should complete successfully as:
- Node.js version now meets all package requirements
- Radix UI configuration is properly set up
- Environment is consistent across all configuration files
